# Safety

- ABS & ASA: toxic gas 
  - needs enclosure that is airtight; Not gaps and a good ventilation system

- IPA (90%+)
  - Safety googles: Should not come in contact with eyes
  - Gloves: Skin contact is not so bad but when you work with it a lot it becomes worse. Some humans react sensitively. It is absorbed by the skin minimally.

- Gases while 3d printing:
  - PM 2.5
    - ABS (1000) > ASA (300) > FiberWood & HIPS (250) > PP (170) > PA12 & PETG (100) > TPU & PLA (50)
    - Increased values at the start of printing and when changing the filament
  - VOCs
    - PLA: Not many bad ones
