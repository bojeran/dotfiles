# Waterproof Prints

- Put print in `dichtol AM Hydro`
  - closes the gaps
  - part in the end: can withstand high water pressure

- Slicer: Minium 3 perimeters (wall thickness)
  - can only withstand low water pressure

- Smoothing the print helps a lot. For example ASA + Aceton.

- Untested method: Use a similar method as with stabilizing wood.
  - Use a vacuum chamber with a bowl of:
    - Penetrating Epoxy (No VOC's)
    - OR: Cactus Juice (goes deeper) (more dangerous)
   
  - The printed part must be kept under the fluid used. 
    - Put something heavy on top of it
 
  - After turning of the vacuum chamber on the air should be pulled out of the 3d-printed part gaps which than get filled by the fluid

  - When the vacuum chamber pressure doesn't go any higher, turn the pump off.
    - Let the vacuum stay like that until no bubbles are visible anymore.
    - Let air into the vaccum chamber
    - Repeat the process one more time.

  - Now in theory the final part must be wrapped in aluminium and put in an ofen with 300 degrees. The epoxy must reach 200 degrees.
    - Obvious problem here is that the plastic will meld...

- Coated with epoxy resin
  - Coat the part with epoxy resin that sits on an aluminium sheet
    - The sides of the aluminium should be rolled up
  - Mixture: XTC-3D + Aceton
  - Coat with a brush or better a dauber bottle
