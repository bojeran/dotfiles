# Choose CAD software

This is a selection of CAD software commonly used to create models for 3D printing.

## No Cost options
- FreeCAD
  - A powerful and flexible open-source parametric CAD tool.
  - Since version 1.0, it became significantly more stable and feature-rich—making it a solid choice for most hobbyists.
  - Offers many ways to approach modeling the same object.

- SolveSpace
  - Offers the most minimalistic and responsive user interface among CAD tools.
    - Many users find the interface fun and refreshingly fast.
  - However, it struggles with overlapping or complex shapes.
    - Exporting such models often leads to errors (e.g., STL files with missing faces or corrupted geometry).
  - It would be a top contender: 
    - With more robust support for complex models
    - With additional core CAD features (e.g., fillets, pattern tools)
  - Can be compiled to run in the browser (WebAssembly), which is a unique bonus.

- Blender with CAD Sketcher (SolveSpace-inspired add-on)
  - Much less practical than using SolveSpace directly for mechanical CAD.
  - Mostly suited for users already comfortable with Blender and in need of basic CAD-like sketching.
  - Users frequently encounter errors and limitations compared to dedicated CAD tools.



## Optional Cost options

- Onshape
  - Very good for collaborative work
  - In the free version, the trade-offs are:
    - All your models are public by default (you cannot make them private unless you pay)
    - You give up commercial-use rights for personal projects
    - Requires login and account data
  - Placing your intellectual property (IP) on a cloud service may not be ideal if privacy is a concern.
  - Despite this, many users praise its clean interface, fast learning curve, and powerful parametric tools.

- Autodesk Fusion 360
  - In the free version, you sacrifice:
    - Commercial-use rights
    - Some features (e.g., export options, simulation tools)
    - Login and cloud dependency
  - Very popular among more serious hobbyists due to its professional-grade capabilities and strong community.
    - Extensive learning content and tutorials are available.
  - Some powerful features for 3D printing, like the volumetric lattice generator, are behind a paywall (Product Design Extension).
  - Like Onshape, being cloud-based may be a drawback for users concerned with IP.

- Solid Edge
  - The free Maker Edition has limitations:
    - Models cannot be used commercially
    - 2D drawings are watermarked
    - Requires registration and login
  - Widely used by professionals in engineering contexts.
  - Extremely powerful and capable—nothing it cannot do in the parametric CAD space.
