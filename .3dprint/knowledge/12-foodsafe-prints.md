# Foodsafe prints
- Don't use a Brass nozzle.
  - Brass nozzles can have lead.

- Usually a bad idea as bacteria have it easy to stick to the surface of 3d-printed parts. Usually the 3d-print is safe for food only on first-time usage. After that, not anymore.

- Borough the properties of a different object that is food-safe
  - For example when you want a special looking cup then you take an existing ugly cup and print somethign around it to make it look different. However, the drinks and your mouth only come in contact with the original cup that is food-safe.
