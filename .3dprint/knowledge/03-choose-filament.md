- TPU in general is awesome as you get safer products that break less easily and you can use PLA as support
- CF PLA: Anything with carbon fiber is by default F-Tier as you cannot touch the filament without a risk getting the small fibers in your skin. However, when only the inner core is having the CF added it becomes much safer.
- PA6-GF with only inner core GF probably does not exist
