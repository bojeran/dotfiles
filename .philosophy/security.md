# Security Philosophy

- Total security does not exist!
- Maybe it exists!

Rabbit hole:
- (1) you cannot trust things you don't know about exactly
- (2) you cannot trust things you don't know completely
- (3) even when you know (1) and (2) you don't know every aspect of it in detail
- (4) When you know (3) you don't know how you can combine
  all the functionalities.
- (5) When you know everything from above you cannot verify it

Because of the above there will be always:
- Bugs, Security holes, Threats
- ...

When you create a security product and people start to use it. Bad
people can develop something against it.

Desperate people try to put just enough resources in security to make it
non-lucrative for a threat actor to attack. But this is hard to evaluate and
depends on the weapons of the threat actor.


# Technology
Some problems can be solved in a way that with the current knowledge of 
physics it is not possible to solve in a life-time.

The complexity of those algorithms and math is possible to understand
for humans.
